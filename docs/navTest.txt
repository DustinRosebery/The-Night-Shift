Navigation testing and persistence testing - Dustin

After creating a new Character test, using the GUI, the room navigation was tested as follows:

-> (input)
<< (output)

********************

** create character test (default stats)
<< updated room description to outside

-> help
<< help menu

-> go onto the roof
<< rand navError

-> go inside the house
<< updated description to living room
<< updated history with room exits

-> help
<< help menu

-> exit


** load character test
<< living room description loaded
<< updated history with room exits

-> go to neverland
<< random navError

-> go to basement
<< updated room description to basement

-> go kitchen
<< random navError

-> save
-> exit


** load test character
<< updated room description to basement

-> go living
<< update room description to living room
<< updated history with living room exits

-> go bedroom
<< updated room description to bedroom

<< updated room description to kitchen

<< updated room description to garage

********************************************************************************
- all rooms tested, can only access rooms based on the current room you are in.
- character persistence saves the location and state of your character

Errors: not all rooms display exits, minor error.
* implement exits for every room.
