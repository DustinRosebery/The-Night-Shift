This room is by far the largest in the house with a chic, yet comfy modern decor. Two large windows with curtains that hang to the floor line the wall next to the front door. The other wall houses A gigantic flat screen tv hanging up over a fancy entertainment center across from two gigantic leather couches and a large black rectangular coffee table. Some tasteful artwork hangs on the far wall flanking what looks like a closet door. The stone tiled floors making moving around quietly a bit more difficult.
